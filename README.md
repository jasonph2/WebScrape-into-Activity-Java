# WebScrape-into-Activity-Java

This project was for an introductory object-oriented programming class in Java at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. A lot of the code in the application had already been written, but I will place all of the code that I had written for this updated feature into this repository. This code webscrapes data from TripAdvisor and places it into CSV formatting which is called through a server. The activity itself calls a GET request from the client that displays the names of TripAdvisor recommendations as well as a corresponding images. 

A demo of what that code actually does can be seen through this Youtube link:
